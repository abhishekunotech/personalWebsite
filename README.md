[My Personal Website](http://abhishek-tuere.me) is a website dedicated to showing off my personal portfolio to potential employers and fellow coders, who might be interested in working with me on different projects. I love security-related stuff, btw. 

On a side note, this is a very clean template to build a personal portfolio website and I invite everyone to fork this repo and create their own website by personalizing this.
## Getting Started

To begin using this template, choose one of the following options to get started:

## Creator

I have used the Start Bootstrap created by **[David Miller](http://davidmiller.io/)**, Owner of [Blackrock Digital](http://blackrockdigital.io/).

Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).

I have made my fair few modifications from the original template, so feel free to shoot hate mail (and a few praises, if you don't mind) to me - uatuere[at]gmail[dot]com
